## Usage:
In the book, each section goes like '1.3.0',1.3.1, 1.3.2, etc.
So each file in this repository will be labled based on it section. _(except the '.' are replaced with '-')_

All you will need to do is copy and paste the code I have and use it.
__Note: 1-3-0.py and 1-3-1.py works are not included.__

Future works will be added soon.

## Plagirism:
To avoid plagirism, try modifying my code into the format of the way you code.
ALL WORKS ARE FREE HERE. If your teacher catches you, this is not my fault, but yours, for you are the one 
who didn't listen to this one sectence.

## Narrative:
```python
print("Hello User")
# prints the function hello user
```
Narrations for code will be added soon.

``#`` can also represent canceled functions.
```python
print("Hi")
#print("Your name??")
#input(">>>")  ---> CANCELED FUNCTIONS
```
